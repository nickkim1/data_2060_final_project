# data_2060_final_project

This is our group's final project on implementing one-vs-all and the all-pairs algorithms from Lecture 5 for the binary logistic regression model we implemented in HW4. To run this assignment:

1. Open the notebook, setting the kernel to the data2060 environment. 
2. Run the environment checks to make sure your environment dependencies are as expected.
3. Run the cells in the notebook.
